# boggle
This is an interactive Boggle-style game board, built using TK Interface graphics and object-oriented programming in Python. The objective is to find words in a scrambled grid of letters, where at least one English word can be found. Users can customize the size of the gameboard, utilize the built-in solver method, and scramble or reset the board at any time while playing.
